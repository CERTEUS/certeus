OpenAPI

This section references the API specification.

- Source (YAML): [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)
- Running locally: when the API Gateway is up, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` (Swagger UI) or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json`.

Note: The full, versioned contracts live in the private core. The public surface provides a lightweight overview only.
