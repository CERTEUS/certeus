# CERTEUS — runtime compatibility constraints
#
# Purpose:
# - Pin core web stack to known‑good versions verified in CI on this repo.
# - Use with pip’s `-c` flag to constrain resolution while installing.
#
# Usage examples:
#   pip install -c constraints/requirements-constraints.txt fastapi uvicorn starlette pydantic cryptography
#   pip install -c constraints/requirements-constraints.txt -r requirements.txt
#
# Notes:
# - These versions reflect the current working environment where tests passed and
#   a smoke test of the API succeeded. Adjust as needed with due diligence.
