# Core Concepts

This page introduces the foundational concepts used across CERTEUS.

## Proof‑Only Architecture

All outputs are accompanied by verifiable proofs. Enforcement at the
ingress/egress boundary ensures every response is justified and auditable.

## Intelligence Modules

- CFE: curved semantic space and geodesic reasoning.
- lexQFT: tunneling across legal/regulatory constraints.
- QTMP: measurement protocols collapsing decision superpositions.

## DSL and Semantics

- AXIOMLOG: [dsl/AXIOMLOG.md](dsl/AXIOMLOG.md)
- LEXLOG: [dsl/LEXLOG.md](dsl/LEXLOG.md)
- OPTLOG: [dsl/OPTLOG.md](dsl/OPTLOG.md)

## Security & Compliance

Zero‑trust by design, PQ‑crypto ready, supply‑chain verified (SLSA‑3), and
privacy‑preserving operations with selective redaction.

## Observability

SLO‑driven metrics, distributed tracing, and runbook‑first operations.
